    <h3>Description</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>Here's a description about our CS422 Project 2: Knockin' on Heaven's Door.</br> 
        The application is called <a href="http://ssikk.github.io/#app">Doorway: Your Door Your Way</a> created by Kyle, Shiwangi, Krishna and Saumya. </br></br>
        Doorway is a Interface Design of a door, both inside and outside which is laid out on a Canvas. You can think of the interface as a high-tech door. This application is a user interface demonstrating various functionalies that a door can have like locking/unlocking, camera to talk to people at your door, notifications, security for your home and other decorating features designed on a JavaScript Canvas. This page will provide you with the features of the Doorway application and instructions on how to use the application. So, let's get started!

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The following is a detailed instruction of how to use the <a href="http://ssikk.github.io/#app">Doorway</a> application. </li>

        <h4>Feature </h4>
        <h4>Snapshot</h4>        
        <h4>How to use it? </h4>

        <h4>State of the door (locked or unlocked)</h4>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">
            <p>
                Initial state of the locking/unlocking mechanism: On the inside door, you have a Red bolt feedback suggesting that the door is locked. When a user from outside unlocks the door, a feedback in the form of a Green ring around the doorknob is shown and the bolt turns Green too. When the user from the outside locks the door, a feedback in the form of a Red ring is shown on the outside and the bolt turns Red too. 
                This feddback ring stays only for few seconds and then disappears. 
            </p>


        <h4>Ability to lock or unlock from inside</h4>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  
            <p>
                User can click on the bolt which can lock or unlock the door from inside. A feedback in the form of color change from Green -> Red and from Red -> Green is sent to the user for locking and unlocking respectively. 
            </p>

        <h4>Menu System</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  
            <p>
                The menu system encapsulates pretty much all the features of our User Interface. The menu icon is a grid like icon just below the door knob. The following are the menu options we have incorporated: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Language</li>
                    <li>Chimes</li>
                    <li>Child Safety</li>
                    <li>Keys</li>
                    <li>Home Alarm</li>
                    <li>Users</li>
                    <li>Camera</li>
                    <li>Mirror</li>
                    <li>Notes</li>
                    <li>Maps</li>
                    <li>Door Log</li>
                    <li>Tutorial</li>
                    <li>Emergency</li>
                    <li>Theme</li>
                </ul>
                selecting an icon would open up the desired functionality. We have made sure that the icons are pretty descriptive but in case a user might get confused, we have added a label below the icons too. When a user is done using the function, we get back to the menu system again.

            <p>
                Part of the menu system is Chimes. When you click on the doorbell icon, chimes window appears. This has a checkbox control. You can select the desired chime and the next time somebody on your door presses a bell, you will have the desired chime for the doorbell. 
            </p>

        <h4>Ability to write message on inside door for General/Specific people</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">

        <h4>Talk to people on the outside with an avatar</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  
            <p></p>

        <h4>Ability to lock or unlock from outside with a key</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  
            <p>
                User profiles: Talking about the users, we have saved/can save user profiles with <i>id, name, handprint, passcode and image </i> information. So, if the user has a handprint and a passcode saved in the system, he/she can unlock the door.  </br>
                Locking/unlocking from the outside is done by using two mechanisms in our system:</br>
                1. By Handprint: In our interface, we have placed a handprint area just besides the door knob at a reachable height. User from the outside if registered in the system, can unlock the door by placing their palm in the provided area. </br>
                2. By passcode: Just besides the handprint area is a passcode area. User can press the button and enter the passcode from their phones. If the phone is registered with the interface, the user can unlock the door.  
            </p>

        <h4>'Push' the doorbell</h4>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  
            <p>
                When the doorbell on the outside is pressed, you can hear a 'ting' sound. There is a doorbell icon in our interface design right above the doorknob.
            </p>

        <h4>Ability to write message on the outside to appear inside</h4>
