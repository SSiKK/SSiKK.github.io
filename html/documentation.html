        <p>Here's a description about our CS422 Project 2: Knockin' on Heaven's Door.</br>
        The application is called <a href="http://ssikk.github.io/#app">Doorway: Your Door Your Way</a> created by Kyle, Shiwangi, Krishna and Saumya. </br></br>
        Doorway is a Interface Design of a door, both inside and outside which is laid out on a Canvas. You can think of the interface as a high-tech door. This application is a user interface demonstrating various functionalies that a door can have like locking/unlocking, camera to talk to people at your door, notifications, security for your home and other decorating features designed on a JavaScript Canvas. This page will provide you with the features of the Doorway application and instructions on how to use the application. So, let's get started!

        <h4>Feature </h4>
        <h4>Snapshot</h4>        
        <h4>How to use it? </h4>

        <h4>State of the door (locked or unlocked)</h4>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/7.PNG" width="80%" alt=""> <br> <br>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/14.PNG" width="80%" alt=""> <br> <br>

            <p>
                Initial state of the locking/unlocking mechanism: On the inside door, you have a Red bolt feedback suggesting that the door is locked. When a user from outside unlocks the door, a feedback in the form of a Green ring around the doorknob is shown and the bolt turns Green too. When the user from the outside locks the door, a feedback in the form of a Red ring is shown on the outside and the bolt turns Red too. 
                This feedback ring stays only for few seconds and then disappears. 
            </p>


        <h4>Ability to lock or unlock from inside</h4>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/15.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br><br>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/14.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br> <br>
            <p>
                User can click on the bolt which can lock or unlock the door from inside. A feedback in the form of color change from Green -> Red and from Red -> Green is sent to the user for locking and unlocking respectively. 
            </p>

        <h4>Menu System</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/3.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br> <br>
            <p>
                The menu system encapsulates pretty much all the features of our User Interface. The menu icon is a grid like icon just below the door knob. The following are the menu options we have incorporated: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Language</li>
                    <li>Chimes</li>
                    <li>Child Safety</li>
                    <li>Keys</li>
                    <li>Home Alarm</li>
                    <li>Users</li>
                    <li>Camera</li>
                    <li>Mirror</li>
                    <li>Notes</li>
                    <li>Maps</li>
                    <li>Door Log</li>
                    <li>Tutorial</li>
                    <li>Emergency</li>
                    <li>Theme</li>
                </ul>
                selecting an icon would open up the desired functionality. We have made sure that the icons are pretty descriptive but in case a user might get confused, we have added a label below the icons too. When a user is done using the function, we get back to the menu system again.

            </p>

        <h4>Themes on the outside door from inside</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/30.PNG" width="80%" alt=""> <br> <br>
            <p>
                We have incorporated in our design themes for seasons like Halloween, Christmas, Birthdays and also traditional wooden, metallic themes. User can display the themes on outside the door from inside by selecting the <i>Themes</i> icon from the menu system.       
            </p>

                Similarly, you can select the theme for the inside door by selecting inside option or you can change on both doors. 
            </p>

        <h4>Ability to see outside the door life-size </h4>

            <p>
                In our interface, you can Turn On the camera for the person outside to see you. The camera icon turns green when you make it see-through. You can make this a condensed view or a life-size view for the person outside. The feedback is given in terms of small map on the inside door where you can see if the person has a full-sized view or condensed view.   
            </p>

                If you want to write a message on the inside door, we give you an option to send it to a specific user by using the saved profile or you can send it to a General user.  

            </p>

        <h4>Personalized information in the presence of multiple people</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  <br><br>
            <p>

            </p>

        <h4>Doorway is your mirror</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/16.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br><br>

        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/13.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br><br>
            <p>
                User profiles: Talking about the users, we have saved/can save user profiles with <i>id, name, handprint, passcode and image </i> information. So, if the user has a handprint and a passcode saved in the system, he/she can unlock the door.  </br>
                Locking/unlocking from the outside is done by using two mechanisms in our system:</br>
                1. By Handprint: In our interface, we have placed a handprint area just besides the door knob at a reachable height. User from the outside if registered in the system, can unlock the door by placing their palm in the provided area. </br>
                2. By passcode: Just besides the handprint area is a passcode area. User can press the button and enter the passcode from their phones. If the phone is registered with the interface, the user can unlock the door.  </br>
                        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/13.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br><br>

                On Authentication success, you will get a feedback of Green ring around the knob and you after a few seconds, the door automatically gets locked. 
            </p>

        <h4>'Push' the doorbell</h4>
            <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/34.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br>
            <p>
                When the doorbell on the outside is pressed as user approaches the door, you can hear a 'ting' sound. There is a doorbell icon in our interface design right above the doorknob.
            </p>

        <h4>Ability to write message on the outside to appear inside</h4>
        <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  <br>
            <p>
                When there is no one in the house, the user gets a message and also the user can leave a message on Outside the door. A scribble pad is opened up to leave this message and the user can Send a note. 
            </p>

        <h4>Tutorials for the first-time users</h4>
        
            <p>
                First time users get a Tutorial to set their account on clicking on the <i>Tutorial </i> icon from the menu. There is a series of steps that the user has to follow to get it all set up. </br>

                1. Welcome screen greets the user in different languages and asks you to press in the hand icon. <br>
                <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/17.PNG" width="80%" alt="">  <br><br>

                <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  <br>
                5. Lastly, you can feed your handprint into the system by selecting the hand icon in the middle and it gives you a feedback by turning the icon into Green.<br>
                <img class="smallImg" src="js/assets/screenshots/" width="80%" alt="">  <br>
