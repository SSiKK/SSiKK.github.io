        <h4>Locking the Door</h4>
        <p>
            Initial designs for locking the door and informing the user that said door
            is locked.
        </p>

        <h4>Camera View</h4>
        <p>
            Initial designs for the camera views which allows the user to view who is outside
            and optionally display who is looking in. In both cases, the images presented show
            the <b>inside</b> user view. This is particularly relevant in that if the <b>inside</b>
            user chooses to reveal themselves to the outside user, the <b>inside</b> user is presented
            with the same view as the outside user, so there is no confusion that they may or may not
            be revealing themselves.
