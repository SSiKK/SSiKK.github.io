        <h4>Locking the Door</h4>
        <p>
            Initial designs for locking the door and informing the user that said door
            is locked.

        <h4>Camera View</h4>
        <p>
            Initial designs for the camera views which allows the user to view who is outside
            and optionally display who is looking in. In both cases, the images presented show
            the <b>inside</b> user view. This is particularly relevant in that if the <b>inside</b>
            user chooses to reveal themselves to the outside user, the <b>inside</b> user is presented
            with the same view as the outside user, so there is no confusion that they may or may not
            be revealing themselves.

        <h4>Avatar</h4>
        <p>
            When in Camera mode, the user has the option to select from an array of interactive Avatars,
            some more...interesting than others. Imagine the surprise on your guests face when its presented
            with a snarling wolf!

        <h4>Door Themes!</h4>
        <p>
            Selection of themes should appear as circular icons offering visual evidence about the type of
            theme to be displayed
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/kyle/themes.jpg" width="60%">

        <h4>Menu Style</h4>
        <p>
            In keeping with Fitt's law, and to give the sense of minimalism, I went with a responsive radial
            menu design when accessing the various features of the Door. The thinking here is, rather than
            have a bunch of icons and options visible and cluttering the door, keep it clear. Only when the user
            taps the door does a Radial menu appear with the available options, radiating outward from the center appear
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/kyle/menu.jpg" width="60%">

        <h4>Unlocking Door</h4>
        <p>
            When outside and attempting to open the door, a large red closed lock icon will appear which will indicate
            the door is locked. To unlock the door, simply tap the lock. From there, a complex interactive multi-dial
            combination puzzle will appear. The user must 'rotate' the dials into the correct position in order for the
            door to become unlocked.
