        <h3>Locking the Door</h3>
        <p>
            Initial designs for locking the door and informing the user that said door
            is locked.

        <h3>Camera View</h3>
        <p>
            Initial designs for the camera views which allows the user to view who is outside
            and optionally display who is looking in. In both cases, the images presented show
            the <b>inside</b> user view. This is particularly relevant in that if the <b>inside</b>
            user chooses to reveal themselves to the outside user, the <b>inside</b> user is presented
            with the same view as the outside user, so there is no confusion that they may or may not
            be revealing themselves.

        <h3>Avatar</h3>
        <p>
            When in Camera mode, the user has the option to select from an array of interactive Avatars,
            some more...interesting than others. Imagine the surprise on your guests face when its presented
            with a snarling wolf!

        <h3>Door Themes!</h3>
        <p>
            Selection of themes should appear as circular icons offering visual evidence about the type of
            theme to be displayed
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/kyle/themes.jpg" width="45%">

        <h3>Menu Style</h3>
        <p>
            In keeping with Fitt's law, and to give the sense of minimalism, I went with a responsive radial
            menu design when accessing the various features of the Door. The thinking here is, rather than
            have a bunch of icons and options visible and cluttering the door, keep it clear. Only when the user
            taps the door does a Radial menu appear with the available options, radiating outward from the center appear
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/kyle/radial.jpg" width="33%">
            <img src="html/images/kyle/menu.jpg" width="33%">
        <p>
            An alternative approach to the menu style would be a less compact or dynamically placed radial menu and instead
            use a menu bar approach, maximizing the space of the door. In the two examples below, one uses purely text-based
            information to display options to the user. In the other example, icons are used to represent menu options
        </p>

            <img src="html/images/kyle/menu3.jpg" width="33%">

        <h3>Menu Selection Style</h3>
        <p>
            Working off the radial menu design, there are a couple of approaches to selection. In the first case, the menu
            steadily generates a long chain of options all connected together detailing the path by which the user has
            come.
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/kyle/selection1.jpg" width="33%">

        <p>
            An alternative would be to have the selected 'parent' icon move to the central/root node, and the relevant branches
            become visualized as 1st order children.
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/kyle/selection0.jpg" width="33%">


        <h3>Unlocking Door</h3>
        <p>
            When outside and attempting to open the door, a large red closed lock icon will appear which will indicate
            the door is locked. To unlock the door, simply tap the lock. From there, a complex interactive multi-dial
            combination puzzle will appear. The user must 'rotate' the dials into the correct position in order for the
            door to become unlocked.

        <h3>Approaching the Door: Inside</h3>
        <p>
            If a user approaches the from the inside and they have their phone (assuming it has been synced) the Door will
            react accordingly by displaying their personalized <i>Doorway</i> information. Should a collection of users
            approach the door,
        </p>

            <img src="html/images/kyle/multi-user.jpg" width="33%">

        <h3>Approaching the Door: Outside</h3>
        <p>
            Should a visitor approach the door, they will be met with the current time, date, and weather, in addition to
            an invitation to leave a message for the home owner. On the homeowner side (inside the house) as they approach they
            will see the message proposed.
        </p>

        <h3>Emergency Alert</h3>
        <p>
            Should the house security system sound an alarm, the Door will respond by 'alerting' the user by displaying
            a large message and flashing emergency imagery. Should the user respond, Icons will display allowing the user
            to either call the Fire department, police, or indicate that the situation is under control and the alarm can
            cease.

        <h3>First time instruction</h3>
        <p>
            First time users will be prompted to tap anywhere on the screen. From there, they will be invited to use their
            phone app which comes with the door in order to take a photo of a QR code, which is synced internally with the
            door's bluetooth such that an automatic syncing occurs. Once this step is finished, the system will invite the
            user to setup a profile etc.
