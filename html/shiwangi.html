        <p>
            Just a little commentary about the thinking process here...this was what I did!
        </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/1.jpg" width = "33%" alt="Simple, yet effective"></br></br>
            <p>
                Locked state is represented by Red color.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/2.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Unlocked state is represented by Green color.
            </p>

            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/3.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Registered Users can use Phone protected password to interface with the door. The key icon turns green as you do send a message to the door. 
            </p>

            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/6.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                As you enter the password from your phone, the key icon turns green. You need to press this button.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/4.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                The door is now unlocked.

            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/8.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Your voice is fed into the system when you register as a User with this high tech door. Your voice recognition is done by the system which unlocks the door.  
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/5.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                I have set an alternative mechanism of opening the door just incase you don't have your phone with you and you want to unlock the door. 
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/7.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Based upon the proximity, if a general person comes closer to the door, a message is displayed on the outside door. The proximity is set to 2m Radius. 
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/9.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>If the person walking by the door is a registered user, the phone is used to detect his/her presence. A personalized message is displayed. The proximity is set to 10m Radius. </p>
            
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/10.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                This is how the default inner interface looks like. The weather, reminders and sticky notes are always displayed for the user leaving the door.  
            </p>
            
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/11.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                The organization of the page is such that the lock is a little lower for even kids to reach. 
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/12.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
                <p>Menu icon and user icons are present always. Users can be added or modified, we will see this later in the sketches. </p>p> 
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/13.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>I wanted to keep an explicit icons for video and voice calls, just to make it simple for users to interface for such basics operations. They do not have to go to Menu icon for this. </p>
            
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/14.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Weather API with Date, time and location will be displayed on top always.
            </p>

            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/15.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Reminders are the important notifications that any person leaving the house can see and take a glance at. These reminders will be synced with the phone.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/16.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                The other last thing is sticky notes. We will discuss this later in detail, although the messages are displayed to the person outside and inside via sending sticky notes from either side.
                A little pen icon can be used to choose pen and send icon for sending messages outside.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/17.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Green color represents Unlocked state.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/18.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>I have put a small callout tutorials for making it easy for a new user to interface with the door. </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/39.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                Register users: Touchning the icon will show you which users are so far registered. They include family members, guests and adding a new user. 
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/19.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
            You can view the information of the registered users. A green check mark means that feature is incorporated in the user profile.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/20.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>Add User: Touching the plus sign would show up the form where you can register information of the new users. Main information includes phone details and voice recognition for 'Unlocking' the door.</p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/21.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                For an individual who is outside the door, he can use the sticky note to leave a message inside the door.
                You can see the send icon the outside door is sending message inwards. I have actually overlayed the sticky notes, the most recent message is displayed on top. 
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/22.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>
                You can talk to the person inside from outside. At this point the microphone icon is turned green on both sides.
            </p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/23.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>The person inside can be viewed from outside on a screen . This featured incorporates Turn Off/On. You may not want to show what you are doing inside so you can just disble. The icon turns Red/Green.</p>
            
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/25.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>When you want the camera to turn on, just press the icon, it turns red and you can see some default image on the outside.</p>
            <img src="html/images/shiwangi/26.jpg" width = "33%" alt=""></br></br>
            <p>This is the menu that I have created for all the functionalities for life size display, safety, chimes, themes for the doors Outside and Inside, mirror, talking to avatar. All these features are nicely encapsulated in a 3 X 3 matrix. </p>
