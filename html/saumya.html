        <h3>Initial Structuring of Design</h3>
        <p>
           I went through several design iterations for the main structuring of the components accessible to the user. I divided the available components into static and dynamic parts.
            The static elements being the "always displayed" elements on the door in the form of the menu system, available widgets and notifications. The dynamic elements of the screen
            are the options that are changing depending on the options selected on the menu system.

        <h4>The First iteration</h4>
        <p>
            The first iteration starts placing the different components on the door. I looked at touchscreen UI specially at tablets to get a feel of how to design the major placing of elements.
            We want certain things to be constantly available to the user. Quantified in the earlier post
            <ul>
                <li> A portion of the screen is devoted to the Menu system for different modes available to the user - [settings], [camera access], [security], [notifications menu]</li>
                <li> A portion of the screen is devoted to the Available widgets such as - [date],[time],[weather], [contact police]</li>
                <li> A portion of the screen devoted to showing the different options available depending upon menu option selected </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            My problem statement is reduced thus to balancing these three regions of the screen in a meaningful way. In a way that is reachable by other the user of all heights, and in a way that does not take too much of the screen space.
            The first two elements i talk about are static elements of the screen. The third is a dynamic element, ie. it changes depending upon what menu item is selected.

           Taskbar ui which is something similar to desktop ui. With a desktop and in ubuntu.
